# Fruit Pantry Assistant

Introducing the Fruit Pantry Assistantâ€”an innovative application designed to enhance your culinary exploration. With the power of YOLOv8, our custom-trained model, at your fingertips, the contents of your pantry and fruit bowl take center stage.

Here's how it works: Upload an image, and our YOLOv8 model steps in to identify the diverse range of fruits at your disposal. To ensure precision, the detections can be refined, putting you in control of the process. Alternatively, bypass the editing phase and delve directly into a selection of nutritious recipes, thoughtfully curated based on your fruit inventory, courtesy of the Chap GPT API.

Embark on a journey that elevates your cooking experience. Uncover the potential within your ingredients and savor the rich flavors that your fruit bowl can offer. Make every meal a delightful adventure. ðŸ˜‹ðŸ¤¤
